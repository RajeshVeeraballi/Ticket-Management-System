Summary	:	The Ticketing Management System is designed for use by organizations to Create, Track and 
		Resolve issues efficiently.
Description	:
* Any Person belonging to the organization can log in to the portal and open a ticket to get an issue resolved.
* If the user is not registered, the user will be redirected to a registration page where the user can register using a unique login.
* When the user creates an issue by selecting the issue type and entering brief description about the issue, it will be assigned to appropriate department Administrator based of the issue type.
* Each department has an administrator and when the admin logs in to the portal he can view list of tickets assigned to him in “My Tickets” page.
* Department’s admin can pick any particular ticket by clicking on issue id number and reassign the tickets to another department if the admin thinks the issue need to be resolved by some other.
* If the admin feels the issue has been resolved, he can close the ticket at any point of time.
* Any logged in user can type the ticket number in the ‘Track Issue Activity’ page and can track the status of a ticket.
